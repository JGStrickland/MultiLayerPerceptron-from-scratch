## Description
This project demonstrates how to implement a **multi layer perceptron(MLP) from scratch** using Python and Numpy, without relying on external machine learning libraries. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to building, training, predicting, and evaluating a MLP model.

The goal is to give a hands-on understanding of the underlying mathematics of linear regression and how it can be programmed manually.
